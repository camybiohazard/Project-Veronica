/* Reload button (docs/USER_GUIDE.md "Reload"). The game reloads only when the trigger is pulled on
   an empty magazine with the weapon raised (player.c bhCPM2_act_wpn, playpch2.c bhCPM2_act_scp):
   bhSearchBullet combines the first ammo in the inventory that reloads the equipped weapon into it,
   as the inventory's combine does (sub1.c Combi_99: up to the weapon's magazine, the rest stays in
   the stack), and mode 70 (bhCPM2_act_rld) plays the reload motion and sounds. The button does
   exactly that whenever the magazine is not full: with the weapon raised (aiming or the scope) as
   the game's own, or lowered wherever the aim button would raise it (standing, walking, running):
   then the weapon comes up straight into
   the reload and goes down after it, as an aimed reload with the aim let go does. Weapons the
   game does not reload by itself (grenade launcher: its rounds are combined in the inventory) and
   unlimited ammo stay as they are. Game thread: player.c bhControlPlayer, right after the mode
   handler, where the game's own switch to mode 70 happens too. A binding shared with another action
   (Aim + button, pc/src/input/bindings.c bind_combo) is held only after a press with aim held, so the
   weapon is up or coming up: a press while it comes up reloads once it is. */
